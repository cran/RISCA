\description{
A data frame with 5943 French kidney transplant recipients from the DIVAT cohort. 
}
\usage{data(dataDIVAT1)}
\format{
 A data frame with 5943 observations for the 7 following variables:
  \describe{
\item{\code{trajectory}}{A numeric vector with the sequences of observed states. The patient evolution can 
 be described according to a 4-state structure: X=1 represents the healthy state, X=2 represents the acute rejection episode, X=3 the definitive return to dialysis and X=4 the death. These times can be right-censored. A vector of covariates is also collected at the transplantation, i.e. the baseline of the cohort.}
\item{\code{time1}}{A numeric vector with the times (in days) between the transplantation and the first clinical event (acute rejection episode, return to dialysis, or death with a functioning graft), or the times to censoring if \code{trajectory=1}.}
\item{\code{time2}}{A numeric vector with the time between the transplantation and the second clinical event (return to dialysis or death with a functioning graft), or the the time to censoring if \code{trajectory=12}.}
\item{\code{ageR}}{A numeric vector with the recipient age (in years) at the transplantation.}
\item{\code{sexR}}{A character vector with the recipient gender.}
\item{\code{year.tx}}{A numeric vector with the calendar year of the transplantation.}
\item{\code{z}}{A numeric vector represents the explicative variable under interest, i.e. the delayed graft function (1=yes, 0=no).}
