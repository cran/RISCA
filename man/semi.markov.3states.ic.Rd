\title{
3-State Semi-Markov Model With Interval-Censored Data
}
\description{
The 3-state SM model includes an initial state (X=1), a transient state (X=2) and an absorbing state (X=3). Usually, X=1 corresponds to disease-free or remission, X=2 to relapse, and X=3 to death. In this illness-death model, the possible transitions are: 1->2, 1->3 and 2->3. The time from X=1 to X=2 is interval-censored. Parameters are estimated by (weighted) Likelihood maximization.

  \item{times1}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the first observation time in X=2. \code{NA} for individuals right-censored in X=1 or individuals who are directly in X=3 after X=1 (without any observation in X=2).}
  \item{times2}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the last follow-up.}
  \item{sequences}{A numeric vector with the sequences of observed states. Four possible values are allowed: 1 (individual right-censored in X=1), 12 (individual right-censored in X=2), 13 (individual who directly observed in X=3 after X=3, without any observation of X=2), 123 (individual who transited from X=1 to X=3 through X=2).}
  \item{weights}{A numeric vector with the weights for correcting the contribution of each individual. When the vector is completed, the IPW estimator is implemented. Default is \code{NULL} which means that no weighting is applied.}
  \item{dist}{A character vector with three arguments describing respectively the distributions of duration time for transitions 1->2, 1->3 and 2->3. Arguments allowed are \code{"E"} for Exponential distribution, \code{"PE"} for the piecewise exponential distribution, \code{"W"} for Weibull distribution or \code{"WG"} for Generalized Weibull distribution. When the user choose \code{"PE"}, the arguments \code{"cut.XX"} have also to be defined.}

Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise. Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}

Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise. Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}

Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise.

 \item{conf.int}{A logical value specifying if the pointwise confidence intervals for parameters and the variance-covariance matrix should be returned. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
 \item{silent}{A logical value specifying if the log-likelihood value should be returned at each iteration. Default is \code{TRUE}, which corresponds to silent mode (no display).}

\details{
Hazard functions available are:
\tabular{rl}{
Exponential distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=1/\sigma} \cr											
Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\nu(\frac{1}{\sigma})^{\nu}t^{\nu-1}} \cr
Generalized Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\frac{1}{\theta}\left(1+\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu}\right)^{\frac{1}{\theta}-1} \nu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu} t^{\nu-1}}
}
with \eqn{\sigma}, \eqn{\nu},and \eqn{\theta>0}. The parameter \eqn{\sigma} varies for each interval when the distribution is piecewise Exponential. We advise to initialize the logarithm of these parameters in \code{ini.dist.12}, \code{ini.dist.13} and \code{ini.dist.23}.

To estimate the marginal effect of a binary exposure, the \code{weights} may be equal to \code{1/p}, where \code{p} is the estimated probability that the individual belongs to his or her own observed group of exposure. The probabilities \code{p} are often estimated by a logistic regression in which the dependent binary variable is the exposure. The possible confounding factors are the explanatory variables of this logistic model.

Two kinds of model can be estimated: homogeneous and non-homogeneous semi-Markov model. In the first one, the hazard functions only depend on the times spent in the corresponding state. Note that for the transitions from the state X=1, the time spent in the state corresponds to the chronological time from the baseline of the study, as for Markov models. In the second one, the hazard function of the transition from the state X=2 to X=3 depends on two time scales: the time spent in the state 2 which is the random variable of interest, and the time spend in the state X=1 as a covariate.
