\title{
3-State Semi-Markov Model
}
\description{
The 3-state SM model includes an initial state (X=1), a transient state (X=2) and an absorbing state (X=3). Usually, X=1 corresponds to disease-free or remission, X=2 to relapse, and X=3 to death. In this illness-death model, the possible transitions are: 1->2, 1->3 and 2->3.

\arguments{
  \item{times1}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the first transition (X=2 or X=3) or to the right-censoring (in X=1 at the last follow-up).}
  \item{times2}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the second transition or to the right censoring (in X=2 at the last follow-up). \code{NA} for individuals right-censored in X=1 or individuals who directly transited from X=1 to X=3.}
  \item{sequences}{A numeric vector with the sequences of observed states. Four possible values are allowed: 1 (individual right-censored in X=1), 12 (individual right-censored in X=2), 13 (individual who directly transited from X=1 to X=3), 123 (individual who transited from X=1 to X=3 through X=2).}
   \item{weights}{A numeric vector with the weights for correcting the contribution of each individual. When the vector is completed, the IPW estimator is implemented. Default is \code{NULL} which means that no weighting is applied.}
  \item{dist}{A character vector with three arguments describing respectively the distributions of duration time for transitions 1->2, 1->3 and 2->3. Arguments allowed are \code{"E"} for Exponential distribution, \code{"PE"} for the piecewise exponential distribution, \code{"W"} for Weibull distribution or \code{"WG"} for Generalized Weibull distribution. When the user choose \code{"PE"}, the arguments \code{"cut.XX"} have also to be defined.}
  \item{cuts.12}{A numeric vector indicating the timepoints in days for the piecewise exponential distribution related to the time from X=1 to X=2. Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise. Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}
  \item{cuts.13}{A numeric vector indicating the timepoints in days for the piecewise exponential distribution related to the time from X=1 to X=3. Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise. Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}
  \item{cuts.23}{A numeric vector indicating the timepoints in days for the piecewise exponential distribution related to the time from X=2 to X=3. Only internal timepoints are allowed: timepoints cannot be \code{0} or \code{Inf}. Default is \code{NULL} which means that the distribution is not piecewise. Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}
  \item{ini.dist.12}{A numeric vector of initial values for the distribution from X=1 to X=2. The logarithm of the parameters have to be declared. Default value is 1.}
  \item{ini.dist.13}{A numeric vector of initial values for the distribution from X=1 to X=3. The logarithm of the parameters have to be declared. Default value is 1.}
  \item{ini.dist.23}{A numeric vector of initial values for the distribution from X=2 to X=3. The logarithm of the parameters have to be declared. Default value is 1.}
 \item{cov.12}{A matrix (or data frame) with the explicative time-fixed variable(s) related to the time from X=1 to X=2.}
 \item{init.cov.12}{A numeric vector of initial values for regression coefficients (logarithm of the cause-specific hazards ratios) associated to \code{cov.12}. Default initial value is 0.}
 \item{names.12}{An optional character vector with name of explicative variables associated to \code{cov.12}.}

 \item{init.cov.13}{A numeric vector of initial values for regression coefficients (logarithm of the cause-specific hazards ratios) associated to \code{cov.13}. Default initial value is 0.}
 \item{names.13}{An optional character vector with name of explicative variables associated to \code{cov.13}.}
  \item{cov.23}{A numeric matrix (or data frame) with the explicative time-fixed variable(s) related to the time from X=2 to X=3.}
 \item{init.cov.23}{A numeric vector of initial values for regression coefficients (logarithm of the cause-specific hazards ratios) associated to \code{cov.23}. Default initial value is 0.}
 \item{names.23}{An optional character vector with name of explicative variables associated to \code{cov.23}.}
 \item{conf.int}{A logical value specifying if the pointwise confidence intervals for parameters and the variance-covariance matrix should be returned. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
 \item{silent}{A logical value specifying if the log-likelihood value should be returned at each iteration. Default is \code{TRUE}, which corresponds to silent mode (no display).}
 \item{precision}{A numeric positive value indicating the required precision for the log-likelihood maximization between each iteration. Default is \eqn{10^{-6}}.}

\details{
Hazard functions available are:
\tabular{rl}{
Exponential distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=1/\sigma} \cr											
Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\nu(\frac{1}{\sigma})^{\nu}t^{\nu-1}} \cr
Generalized Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\frac{1}{\theta}\left(1+\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu}\right)^{\frac{1}{\theta}-1} \nu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu} t^{\nu-1}}
}
with \eqn{\sigma}, \eqn{\nu},and \eqn{\theta>0}. The parameter \eqn{\sigma} varies for each interval when the distribution is piecewise Exponential. We advise to initialize the logarithm of these parameters in \code{ini.dist.12}, \code{ini.dist.13} and \code{ini.dist.23}.

To estimate the marginal effect of a binary exposure, the \code{weights} may be equal to \code{1/p}, where \code{p} is the estimated probability that the individual belongs to his or her own observed group of exposure. The probabilities \code{p} are often estimated by a logistic regression in which the dependent binary variable is the exposure. The possible confounding factors are the explanatory variables of this logistic model.
