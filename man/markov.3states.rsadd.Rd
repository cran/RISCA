\title{
3-state Relative Survival Markov Model with Additive Risks
}
\description{
The 3-state Markov relative survival model includes an initial state (X=1), a transient state (X=2), and the death (X=3). The possible transitions are: 1->2, 1->3 and 2->3. Assuming additive risks, the observed mortality hazard is the sum of two components: the expected population mortality (X=P) and the excess mortality related to the disease under study (X=E). The expected population mortality hazard (X=P) can be obtained from the death rates provided by life tables of statistical national institutes. These tables indicate the proportion of people dead in a calendar year stratified by birthdate and gender.

\arguments{
  \item{times1}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the first transition (X=2 or X=3) or to the right-censoring (in X=1 at the last follow-up).}
  \item{times2}{A numeric vector with the observed times in days from baseline to the second transition or to the right censoring (in X=2 at the last follow-up). \code{NA} for individuals right-censored in X=1 or individuals who directly transited from X=1 to X=3.}

Four possible values are allowed: 1 (individual right-censored in X=1), 12 (individual right-censored in X=2), 13 (individual who directly transited from X=1 to X=3), 123 (individual who transited from X=1 to X=3 through X=2).}
  \item{weights}{A numeric vector with the weights for correcting the contribution of each individual. Default is \code{NULL} which means that no weighting is applied.}

Piecewise model is only allowed for exponential distribution.}

 \item{conf.int}{A logical value specifying if the pointwise confidence intervals for parameters and the variance-covariance matrix should be returned. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
 \item{silent}{A logical value specifying if the log-likelihood value should be returned at each iteration. Default is \code{TRUE}, which corresponds to silent mode (no display).}
 \item{precision}{A numeric positive value indicating the required precision for the log-likelihood maximization between each iteration. Default is \eqn{10^{-6}}.}

\details{
Hazard functions available are:
\tabular{rl}{
Exponential distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=1/\sigma} \cr											
Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\nu(\frac{1}{\sigma})^{\nu}t^{\nu-1}} \cr
Generalized Weibull distribution \tab \eqn{\lambda(t)=\frac{1}{\theta}\left(1+\left(\frac{t}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu}\right)^{\frac{1}{\theta}-1} \nu\left(\frac{1}{\sigma}\right)^{\nu} t^{\nu-1}}
}
with \eqn{\sigma}, \eqn{\nu},and \eqn{\theta>0}. The parameter \eqn{\sigma} varies for each interval when the distribution is piecewise Exponential. We advise to initialize the logarithm of these parameters in \code{ini.dist.12}, \code{ini.dist.13} and \code{ini.dist.23}.

To estimate the marginal effect of a binary exposure, the \code{weights} may be equal to \code{1/p}, where \code{p} is the estimated probability that the individual belongs to his or her own observed group of exposure. The probabilities \code{p} are often estimated by a logistic regression in which the dependent binary variable is the exposure. The possible confounding factors are the explanatory variables of this logistic model.
