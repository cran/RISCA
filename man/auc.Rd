\title{
Area Under ROC Curve From Sensitivities And Specificities.
}
\description{
This function computes the area under ROC curve by using the trapezoidal rule.
}
\usage{
auc(sens, spec)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{sens}{A numeric vector with the sensitivities}
  \item{spec}{A numeric vector with the sensitivities}
  }
\details{
This function computes the area under ROC curve using the trapezoidal rule from two vectors of sensitivities and specificities. The value of the area is directly returned.
